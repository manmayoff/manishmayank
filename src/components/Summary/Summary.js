    Hello,
    I'm a software engineer with a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering
    from IIT Kanpur, complemented by a minor in Industrial Management and
    Engineering. With 1.5 years of hands-on experience at Wells Fargo, I
    specialize in full stack development using ReactJS, Node.js, MongoDB, SQL,
    Python, and Django. I am also deeply interested in data science,
    particularly in NLP and Deep Learning, and have worked on several projects
    exploring these areas. My goal is to create impactful solutions that bridge
    software engineering with cutting-edge data science.
